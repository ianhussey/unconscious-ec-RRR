# Unconscious EC Registered Replication Report

Measures, researcher instructions, data processing, analysis, and meta analysis for a Registered Replication Report of Olsen & Fazio (2002) to examine the evidence for evaluative conditioning outside of awareness. 

## To do

- processing code has sections to be removed (commented with !!!)
- Three sets of analyses will be carried out:
  - One excluding aware participants using the Olson & Fazio procedure
  - One excluding aware participants using Bar-Anan, De-Houwer & Nosek (2010) procedure.
  - Bar-Anan modified
    - implemented but need checking based on feedback from Tal.
    - note in prereg which is the replicaiton, and which are our extensions ***
- analysis needs multivariate moderator meta analysis
- data coding processing: remove "awareness_1_words_and_images" and add new method that can have three judges.
- Change processing to use two different files (and a third for the new q).
