## Translation and stimuli pretesting

Tal to send each site "translation and pretesting package to be sent to sites.zip", found in the folder "measures/2 translation and stimuli selection/2 master/translation and pretesting package to be sent to sites.zip". They'll return both translated excel files and stimuli choices.

### Translation Process:

The text files will first be translated from English into the native language used at a given lab by one member
of that participating team. This translation will then be backwards translated into English by another member of that same team who was not involved in the initial translation process. This backward translation should be returned to Sean (sean.hughes@ugent.be) and Tal (Tal.MoranYorovich@ugent.be) for verification and approval. Sean will go over the translated files and verify that they are in line with the original version.  If necessary (i.e., where the backward translation is not approved) the translation process will be repeated until approval is provided.

## Creation of finalized materials for data collection

Tal to:

2. Copy the translated excel files returned by each site to their "text" folder, located at "measures/3 site-specific measures for data collection/[SITE_NAME]/text/".
2. Visually screen these files for formatting (e.g., linebreaks), in both excel and by running the task (using the .py file in psychopy). If necessary, make changes or liaise with the site about changes.
4. Screen the awareness_2b.xlsx and instructions_surveillance.xlsx files **in particular** for containing the correct names of the pokemon to be used at that site. These must match those in the images or this awareness question/task instructions will be meaningless. 
5. Take the list of pre-screened stimuli and create the appropriately named and formatted stimuli files. Place these in each site's "stimuli" folder, located at "measures/3 site-specific measures for data collection/[SITE_NAME]/stimuli/".
6. Zip each site's "site-specific measures for data collection" folder and send to that site for use in data collection. 

## Phase 3

Sites collect data from circa 5 participants and send this data to Ian/Tal for us to check they are collecting data correctly. When these have been verified, the site can continue to full data collection. Data from these 5 participants will be included in the final dataset assuming no issues are found.

## Phase 4

Sites create one zip of all the csv files created by the experiment and return to Ian for analysis. Note that it is the csv files we need, not the excel files or otherwise.
