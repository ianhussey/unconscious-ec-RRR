# Unconscious EC RRR

Measure development done in the (master) measures folder. 

The most recent version of this is then copied into each of the "for distribution" folders for customisation and distribution to the labs. 

Phase 1 folder is to be sent to the researchers first. This contains only the excel files needed to translate the tasks. If a site is prerating the stimuli for familiarity and neutralness Tal will also send these materials separatesly. Sites should return the files for checking by Ian and Tal (excel files and stimuli lists for image creation, respectively). 

- Teams will be sent materials for pretesting and the excel files to translate. NB this translation should include the changing of stimuli names based on the preregistered method. 
- They should return the translated excel files for us to check, along with the list of which stimuli they'll use. 
- We'll check the excel files (Ian) and stimuli files (Tal) for compliance to the agreed screen presentation format. We'll add the correct stimuli exemplar files for that site to the phase 2 measures folder, along with a customized site id excel file that records the collection site into the raw data. We'll also run the trials_generator Rmarkdown file, which will create a unique set of randomised trials for each participant that will be run. We'll then return a complete phase 2 measures folder to each site, which is to be used for data collection.
- Data collection
  - Sites should collect data from 5 participants and send this data to Ian for checking for verification. When these have been verified free of issues, then the site can continue to full data collection. Data from these 5 participants will be included in the final dataset assuming no issues are found. 

When checked, these stimuli and images should be copied into the Phase 2 folders, which will then contain the customised measures. The stimuli generator script will then be run for each set of measures, to generate a unique, randomised set of trials for each site. Lastly, the "data collection site" file must be customised. When these steps are complete, the phase 2 files will be zipped and distributed to each site so they can be used for data collection.
