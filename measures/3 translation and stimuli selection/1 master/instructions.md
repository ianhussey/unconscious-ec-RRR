# Unconscious EC RRR

## Localisation and stimuli pre-ratings

### Text

In order to change all text used within the experiment to your local language, translate the text in these excel files to your local language. The PsychoPy script used to deliver the experiment will pull all the text to be used in the experiment from these files. 

All text in light blue boxes should be translated. Text in other boxes should isn't editable as the sheets are protected. 

Please don't edit or append the file names, as the psychopy scripts look for files of these exact names. 

NB Please ensure you preserve the use of line breaks used in the files so that they are presented correctly on screen. Press alt-return to enter a line break in excel.

### Backward translation process

The text files will first be translated from English into the native language used at a given lab by one member of that participating team. This translation will then be backwards translated into English by another member of that same team who was not involved in the initial translation process. 

This backward translation should be returned to Sean (sean.hughes@ugent.be) and Tal (tmo286@gmail.com) for verification and approval. 

Sean will go over the translated files and verify that they are in line with the original version. 

If necessary (i.e., where the backward translation is not approved) the translation process will be repeated until approval is provided.



### Stimuli

You should already have discussed with Tal whether you will be able to have a sample prerate the stimuli for valence in order to select unfamiliar neutral stimuli, using the preregistered method for selecting these. If not, you can use the ones we prerated using an online sample. If not, please talk to Tal about this. 

If you are prerating stimuli at your site, please follow the instructions on how to do so (see separate "instructions for pretesting" document in the stimuli folder) and return the results (i.e., the list of stimuli to be used, the analysis code and a short summary of the results) to Tal so that she can prepare image stimuli using these that are customized for your data collection site (tmo286@gmail.com). 

### Finalized measures

Once you have returned both the approved translated excel files and the list of stimuli to be used in the study (if applicable) to Ian, Sean and Tal, we'll check both of these and then send you a finalised set of materials for you to use in your data collection.
