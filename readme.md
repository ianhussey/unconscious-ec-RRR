# Unconscious EC Registered Replication Report

Measures, researcher instructions, data processing, analysis, and meta analysis for a Registered Replication Report of Olsen & Fazio (2002) to examine the evidence for evaluative conditioning outside of awareness. 

## To do

- highest point of filler 2 is still 7 not 5, despite code saying 5?
- processing code has sections to be removed (commented with !!!)
- update "how to" to say we'll construct materials ourselves, and to say some processing to be done by the labs
- Three sets of analyses will be carried out:
  - One excluding aware participants using the Olson & Fazio procedure
  - One excluding aware participants using Bar-Anan, De-Houwer & Nosek (2010) procedure.
  - Bar-Anan modified
    - implemented but need checking based on feedback from Tal.
    - note in prereg which is the replicaiton, and which are our extensions ***
- Read the manuscript to see what miguel wants reported, whether my code matches this.
- check all excel files are locked
- create site specific processing and analysis files, and add instructions for these.
