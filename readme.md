how to guide

- download and install psychopy version 3.0.5: https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/tag/3.0.5
- make coder read only:
  - prior to collecting data, inside psychopy, click file>open>experiment.py
  - click settings (the icon with the wrench and screwdriver across one another)
  - click the "coder" tab
  - check the box next to "read-only". this prevents accidential changes to the experiment.py file when collecting data.
