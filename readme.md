# Unconscious EC Registered Replication Report

Measures, researcher instructions, data processing, analysis, and meta analysis for a Registered Replication Report of Olsen & Fazio (2002) to examine the evidence for evaluative conditioning outside of awareness. 

## To do

- Is a BF analysis needed?
- Code for stimuli pretesting doesn't run: NAs prevent the BFttests running correctly
- square github with osf
- update analysis general strategy re miguel's comments
- update processing to integrate the two types of scoring
  - One excluding aware participants using the Olson & Fazio procedure
  - One excluding aware participants using Bar-Anan, De-Houwer & Nosek (2010) procedure.
  - Bar-Anan modified
    - implemented but need checking based on feedback from Tal.
    - note in prereg which is the replicaiton, and which are our extensions ***
  - 4th?
    - processing for all needs reworking. data coding processing: remove "awareness_1_words_and_images" and add new method that can have three judges.
      - are the existing ones right? look at the patterns in the pilot data among the three, which i thought should be nested differently.
    - 4th analysis needs adding to analysis
- add all four sets of analyses that implement the above
  - multivariate moderator meta analysis
  - what does the submitted manuscript say on this???
