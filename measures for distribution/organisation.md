# Unconscious EC RRR

## Phase 1

Phase 1 folder is to be sent to the researchers first. This contains only the excel files needed to translate the tasks. If a site is prerating the stimuli for familiarity and neutralness Tal will also send these materials separatesly. Sites should return the files for checking by Ian and Tal (excel files and stimuli lists for image creation, respectively). 

- Teams will be sent materials for pretesting and the excel files to translate. NB this translation should include the changing of stimuli names based on the preregistered method. 
- They should return the translated excel files for us to check, along with the list of which stimuli they'll use. 
- We check the excel files (Ian) and stimuli files (Tal) for compliance to the agreed screen presentation format. 

## Phase 2

### Ian to:

1. Copy the finalized version of the measures folder to that site's stimuli folder.
2. Copy the translated files from Phase 1 into the measures folder, replacing the old files.
3. Customize the site id for each site. 
4. Run the trials_generator Rmarkdown file
5. Delete the following files: 
   - trials_generator.Rmd
   - experiment.psyexp
   - readme.md
6. Return a complete phase 2 measures folder to each site, which is to be used for data collection.

### Tal to:

1. add the correct stimuli exemplar files for that site to the phase 2 measures folder

### Ian to then:

1. Zip the phase 2 measures folders and send each to the appropriate site, which is used for data collection.

## Phase 3

Sites collect data from circa 5 participants and send this data to Ian for checking for verification. When these have been verified free of issues, the site can continue to full data collection. Data from these 5 participants will be included in the final dataset assuming no issues are found. 

## Phase 4

Sites create one zip of all the csv files created by the experiment and return to Ian for analysis.
