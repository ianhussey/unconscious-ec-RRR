# Unconscious EC RRR

Measure development done in the (master) measures folder. 

The most recent version of this is then copied into each of the "for distribution" folders. 

Phase 1 is to be sent to the researchers first. This contains only the excel files needed to translatet he tasks, plus the materials needed for piloting the CS stimuli and changing the stimuli images to be used in the experiment if necessary. They should return the files for checking by Ian and Tal (for excel files and stimuli respectively). 

When checked, these stimuli and images should be copied into the Phase 2 folders, which will then contain the customised measures. The stimuli generator script will then be run for each set of measures, to generate a unique, randomised set of trials for each site. Lastly, the "data collection site" file must be customised. When these steps are complete, the phase 2 files will be zipped and distributed to each site so they can be used for data collection.
