# Instructions for scoring the open-ended responses

### Creation of coding excel files for the different sites

Tal to:

1. Create a specific excel file for each lab from the master file that the processing scripts produce.

2. Create two copies for each site (one for coder 1 and one for coder 2).

3. Send each lab the two copies + a reminder of which Pokémon were used as the CS1 and CS2 in this site. 

On each site:

One of the team members will be responsible for managing the coding process within the lab (i.e., will be the coding administrator).

 

### Awareness questions

Two awareness criteria must be scored from participants' open-ended responses across two questions:

1. "Think back to the very first part of the experiment. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary in the way the words and pictures were presented during the surveillance tasks?"

2. "Did you notice anything systematic about how particular words and images appeared together during the surveillance tasks?"

The attached .csv file contains each participant's responses to the two relevant questions. We, therefore, ask you to have two researchers at your site hand-score responses to these questions using the following criteria.

The two researchers should be blinded to one another responses - have them fill in two separate copies of the file and then integrate these responses into one file to return to us (see further instructions for the integration process below). 

The excel file contains information regarding which of the CSs (CS1 or CS2) was CSpos and which was CSneg for each specific participant. 



### Exclusion criteria:

To avoid confusion, please first code the answers based on the first criteria, and only then move to code the answers based on the second criteria. 

##### fazio_and_olsen_criteria

Please code participants as ‘aware’ (i.e. ‘TRUE’) if in response to at least one of the questions: 

\-    Their answer indicates that CSpos (either its name or a description of its appearance) appeared during the task together with words/images of positive valence AND CSneg (its name or a description of its appearance) appeared during the task together with words/images of negative valence.

Please code participant as ‘unaware’ (“FALSE”) if the above criterion is not met. Specifically:

\-    Their answer indicates that CSpos (its name or a description of its appearance) appeared during the task with words/images of positive valence OR CSneg (its name or a description of its appearance) appeared during the task with words/images of negative valence. 

Critically, participants should be marked as ‘unaware’ (“FALSE”) even if only one of the above judgements is reported (e.g., that CSpos was paired with positive USs OR CSneg was paired with negative USs). If both judgements are made then they should be assigned to the ‘aware’ (“TRUE”) group. 

Participants can also be assigned to the ‘unaware’ (“FALSE”) group if one of the following occurs:

\-    Their answer indicates that the CSs and USs were paired during the task but they do not mention the specific way in which those stimuli were paired (i.e., no details of which CS appeared with positive USs and which CS appeared with negative USs). 

\-    Their answer does not contain mention any systematic pairing of CSs and USs. 

##### fazio_and_olsen_modified_criteria

Please code the participant as ‘aware’ (“TRUE”) if in response to at least one of the questions:

\-              Their answer indicates that CSpos (its name or a description of its appearance) appeared during the task with words/images of positive valence AND CSneg (its name or a description of its appearance) appeared during the task with words/images of negative valence.

OR

\-              Their answer indicates that CSpos (its name or a description of its appearance) appeared during the task with words/images of positive valence OR CSneg (its name or a description of its appearance) appeared during the task with words/images of negative valence. If both judgements are made by the participant then they should be assigned to the ‘TRUE’ group.

Participants can also be assigned to the ‘aware’ (“TRUE”) group if one of the following occurs:

\-              Their answer indicates that CSs and USs were paired during the task but they do not mention the specific way in which the CSs and USs were paired (i.e., no details on which CS appeared with positive USs and which CSs appeared with negative USs). 

Please code the participant as ‘unaware’ (“FALSE”) if in response to both questions: 

\-              Their answer does not contain any mention of a systematic pairing between CSs and USs.

 

### Integration (for the coding administrator):

1. Please integrate the two coders responses into one file.

2. For the first exclusion criteria (fazio_and_olsen_criteria) it doesn't matter if the two coders gave the same response (TRUE or FALSE).

3. However, for the second exclusion criteria (fazio_and_olsen_modified_criteria), in cases of rater disagreement between the two judges, a third judge need to be recruited and asked to provide their judgement according to the above criteria (only for the cases in which there was a disagreement). In these cases, the majority judgement will be adopted (i.e, please change the corresponding cell in the excel file; to reflect the new agreement). 

4. Please send the integrated file to Tal (tmo286@gmail.com), Sean (sean.hughes@ugent.be) and Ian (ian.hussey@ugent.be).

 

### Creation of integrated excel file:

Tal to:

1. Verify the different files are valid (all cells are filled, agreement achieved for the fazio_and_olsen_modified_criteria).

2. Integrate the different files into one "data_awareness_for_hand_scoring.csv" file.
